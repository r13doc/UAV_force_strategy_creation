There are many types of Artifician intelligence. And honestly it is only patterns. And humanity did not create a real AI like human being.

Objectives Operational algorithm for controllin thousands  combat drones(UAV):

- all UAV objects control several main UAV and it can change places when it need.
Change places it is like when action from cell in network graph move to another cell in different algorithms.
It may be three - five main controling UAV objects, say:
  we have 1000 combat drones and separate it to threee combat groups with three leaders(main obgects UAV) they control own groups :
  - first group - it is most higher flight point, task for this group it is controlling stratosphere and a cosmic space, intelligence option,
  defence and destruction from enemy's high-design military objects, radar intelligence, passive radars and others potential risks in combat operations...
  - second (middle) group it is main group and have a mission for destruction an enemy force on the earth and in the sky
  - third group it is group that have intelligence option, defence from earth, sky enemy attacks.
  Tehere are various flight height for this groups,
