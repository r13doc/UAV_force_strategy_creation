There are many types of Artifician intelligence. And honestly it is only patterns. And humanity did not create a real AI like human being.

Objectives Operational algorithm for controllin thousands  combat drones(UAV):
- according to the low of nature all UAV objects should controlling several main UAV objects and it can change places when it need.
Change places it is like when action from cell in network graph move to another cell in different algorithms.
It may be three - five main controling UAV objects, say:
  we have 1000 combat drones and separate it to threee combat groups with three leaders(main obgects UAV) they control own groups :
  - first group it is most higher point more then 30000 km, task for this group it is controlling stratosphere and a cosmic space,
  defence from enemy's high-design military objects, radar intelligence, passive radars and others...
  - second (middle) group
