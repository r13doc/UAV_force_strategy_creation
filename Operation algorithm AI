Objectives Operational algorithm for controllin thousand  combat drones(UAV):

- all UAV objects control several main UAV and it can change places when it need.
It may be three - five main controling UAV objects, say:
  we have 1000 combat drones and separate it to threee combat groups with three leaders(main obgects UAV) they control own groups :
  - first group - it is most higher flight point, task for this group it is controlling stratosphere and a cosmic space, intelligence option,
  defence and destruction from enemy's high-design military objects, radar intelligence, passive radars and others potential risks in combat operations...
  - second (middle) group it is main group and have a mission for destruction an enemy force on the earth and in the sky
  - third group it is group that have intelligence option, defence from earth, sky enemy attacks.
  Tehere are various flight height for this groups: first group - the higher (top) flight point,
                                                    second(middle) group - the average flight point,
                                                    third group - bottom flight point.

- there are 100 combat drones and location of this group specify the main force command. It is еру reserve group.

- all three groups disposed in staggered-order
