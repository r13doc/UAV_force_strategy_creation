Price it's one of the most important property, which have an influence for development a new technological weapons.
It's have many various dependencys:

1. Location the factory for UAV fabrication and design, analysis and testing:
- all that activity must be take place in one factory
- the location of the factory have to in the depths of the country
- it may be in position underground, on ground or in solid rocks of any nature
- humidity level that place must be quite low
- and etc.

2. Ð¡reation, design, testing, implementation:
- for creation UAV corps used new ideas and designs, it need because new technology have a huge expansion
and it need be a several steps ahead
- testing new design and technology with modeling programs and computing math
- real practicemost important activity for testing sowtware, hardware, design
- and etc.

3. Materials and technology:
- all materials and technology creates in the factory, all components are made in own country
- redesign and rediscove new material is a very important for creating UAV corps objects
- for design new materials we use new knowledge
-and etc.

4. Autonomous energy supply:
- all factory use nuclear or hydrogen engines for autonomus energy
- it use five-ten lewels of protection from system errors, bugs etc.
- and etc.

5. Storage facility materials for complete production cycle UAV:
- complete cycle of UAV technology create and collect in one factory
- and etc.

6. Personal for realisation UAV corps project:
- technical engineers, software engineers, nuclear physicists, mathematicians, mechanical engineer, materials engineers
- each group engineers consists of not less than three person
- balance of age engineers: old expert-everage professional-young professional
- and etc.

7. Security and conspiracy, defence:
- for one cycle factory must create 1000 combat drones and it will be a one cell
- and it need create a good conspiracy and defence for factory and combat drones
- factory in case of war must used like base a new cells for military UAV corps
- and etc.
